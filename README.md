# High_End_Bicycle_Production

### Project Overview
---
This project is about creating a Value Stream Map (VSM) diagram for the production of high-end bicycles which involves visualizing the process from raw materials to finished products for a business process.

### Symbols Used
---
- Process Box: Rectangles representing each step in the process
- Inventory: Triangles representing inventory between processes
- Material Flow: Arrows showing the flow of materials
- Information Flow: Dotted arrows indicating information flow
- Data Box: Rectangle below the process box for metrics and key data
